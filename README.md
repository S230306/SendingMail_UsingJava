5. JavaMail API Troubleshooting Tips:
java.net.UnknownHostException comes when your system is not able to resolve the IP address for the SMTP server, it might be wrong or not accessible from your network. For example, GMail SMTP server is smtp.gmail.com and if I use smtp.google.com, I will get this exception. If the hostname is correct, try to ping the server through command line to make sure itâ€™s accessible from your system.
